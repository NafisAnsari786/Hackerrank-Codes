    FROM CustomerOrders
),
ConsecutiveOrders AS ( 
    SELECT c1.CustomerID
    FROM CustomerOrderMonths c1
    INNER JOIN CustomerOrderMonths c2
    ON c1.CustomerID = c2.CustomerID
    AND (
        (c1.Year = c2.Year AND c1.Month = c2.Month - 1) OR
        (c1.Year = c2.Year - 1 AND c1.Month = 12 AND c2.Month = 1)
    )
)
SELECT DISTINCT CustomerID
FROM ConsecutiveOrders;
